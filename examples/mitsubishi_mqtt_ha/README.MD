An ESP8266 sketch adding Heatpump conrol to Home Assitant using MQTT discovery.

Update the mitsubishi_mqtt_ha.h file with your WiFi and MQTT credentials. Set HA's MQTT discovery topic accordingly (the default is already configured in the file). If you have more than heatpump, set the ha_friendly_name setting to a unique name for each heatpump.
